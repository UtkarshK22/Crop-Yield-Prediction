Crop Yield Prediction Using AI

This project uses machine learning to predict crop yield based on key agricultural parameters such as rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage. It aims to support sustainable agriculture by helping farmers make data-driven decisions.



Problem Statement

To develop an AI-based model that predicts crop yield using environmental and agricultural data to optimize resource utilization and promote sustainable farming practices.



Project Goals

- Predict crop yield in tons/hectare.
- Support sustainable farming by improving decision-making.
- Provide a flexible model that can be adapted for local datasets.


Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn


Project Structure

Dataset Info:-

A sample dataset is provided in crop_yield_dataset.csv with the following columns:

Year
Average_Rainfall_mm
Fertilizer_Used_kg_per_hectare
Avg_Temperature_C
Yield_tons_per_hectare

Model Used:-

Linear Regression: For simple, interpretable yield forecasting.
Can be extended to other models like Decision Trees or Random Forests.

Output:-

Displays predicted yield values.
Visualizes relationship between features and target.

Sustainability Impact:-

By accurately forecasting crop yields, farmers can:
Minimize wasteful use of fertilizers and water.
Plan harvest and resource allocation efficiently.
Improve food security with better yield planning.
